/*
TO-DO and STRUCTURE:
    CAMERA (CLASS)
        -Object that can adjust focus, record, turn off and on, and take pictures, etc...

    WIFI (CLASS)
        -A check for wifi connection and return speed?
        -Does a send/recieve function need to be written or can we assume that ROS will handle this?

    MANUAL CONTROLLER
        -The controller plugs directly into the cube. We need a way to switch priority from the nano to the manual controller. 
        If this doesn't work, we can try to send manual controlls to the nano directly.

    CUBE (CLASS)
        - Establish connection to the cube, send waypoints, and recieve data from the cube.
