     * Returns the next point for a creeping line search pattern
     * Input:
     *     drone  -  uas object
     *     env    -  enviornment object
     *     path   -  length 4 vector of the previously commanded point and yaw [x, y, z, psi]
     *     Any units, so long as consistent between passed arguments
     * Output:
     *     path   - length 4 vector of the new commanded point and yaw [x, y, z, psi]
     *     drone  - uas object with p property updated
     *     env    - enviornment object with boundery property updated
     * The function makes use of the uas p iterator property to track the
     * phases of the creeping line search pattern with the following:
     *     0:    has not begun the search pattern
     *     1:    is moving to the start point of the search pattern
     *     even: is moving left to right (along x)
     *     odd:  is moving up or down (along y)
     * The value of p is incremented once the drone has entered the search phase, 
     * and after when it reaches the commanded point for that phase of the search pattern.
     * The pattern is constructed such that the left/right phases always moves to and from W away from the boundary,
     * while the up/down phases only go either up or down during a search,
     * with the up/down length calculated using L and the value of p. 
     * The upper/lower bounds are calculated from how many Ls fit in the y boundary.
     */

     *   notes for further implementation:
     *   add drone, enviornment class file in HUB/src
     *   env.bounds in format [[x1, y1]; [x2, y2]]
     *   drone.state in format [x, y, z]
     *   assumes variables of drone and env are public
